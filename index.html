      <p>
        Hey, my name is Swann Mitchem. I am 22 years old. I have a beautiful girlfriend named Alicia as well as a beautiful, 7 month old daughter named Amiyah. I am an Army Veteran and a former truck driver. Originally from Indianapolis, IN, the Army brought me to Oklahoma for the last few years and my family brought me to Lakewood, Washington. Currently a full time father and student. My interests include gaming, rap/hip hop, basketball, and learning about the stock market. As far as education, I only have a high school diploma at the moment.
